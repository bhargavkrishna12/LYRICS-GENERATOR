                They ain't never had the dedication
                People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
                Yeah, we made it

                I was patient, yeah-oh
                I was patient, ay-oh
                Now I can scream that we made it
                Now everywhere-everywhere I go they say 'gratulations
                Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
                I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
                I'm looking for someone to call, baby
                But right now I got a situation
                Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
                Big rings, champagne
                My life is like a ball game
                But instead I'm in the trap though
                Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
                Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
                Top floor lifestyle, Honcho and Post
                Malone, I got a play on my phone, ay

                Said some shit done changed
                Ever since we was on
                I dreamed it all
                Ever since I was young
                They said I wouldn't be nothing
                Now they always say congratulations
                Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
                They ain't never had the dedication
                People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
                Yeah, we made it
